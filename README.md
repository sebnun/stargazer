# Stargazer

This is a simple Next.js app to view some basic info of a limited set of repositories.

As seen on the git history, I began implementing this app with the idea of trying out [React server components](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html) and [Suspense](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html) from React 18, but due to time constraints I ended up implementing it with stable features.

## Run locally
